      <description>Inspired by videos such as “Undertale – Megalovania {8 FDD, 2 SM}” by MrSolidSnake745 on YouTube, I decided in May of 2015 to try and make musical floppy drives of my own just so I can see what I could do with them.

The final cost ended up being around 70 dollars, something I was quite happy with.</description>
