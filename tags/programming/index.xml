      <description>The school I work for just migrated our Powerschool server offsite, introducing an issue for our internal applications which relied on the ODBC API to pull the class schedules for each day. Because the API does not employ encryption, simply opening the port on the remote server was not an option.
SSH provides the ability to tunnel network traffic through an encrypted SSH session. By binding this tunnel to the internal computer’s network interface, any other computer can simply connect to the proxy host.</description>

      <description>Often times I find myself wanting to try out some piece of software from Github, a tutorial, or just have a fresh environment to work in that will avoid causing damage to my computer’s local environment. Typically I would use Vagrant to spin up a virtual machine, and delete it after. This is a time consuming and tedious process.
Docker provides a convienent method which gives you a clean environment that is destroyed when you finish with it.</description>
