      <description>Today I had an amazing opportunity to take a tour and take photographs inside of NASA Langley Reasearch Center’s aircraft hanger. I thought I would share some of my photos and share some information on each one because some of it was really interesting.
What I’ll do is go through the pictures I have and explain some things about them right after each, so scroll down for some cool science equipment!</description>
