      <description>August 19th through 23rd I spent the week with JC Media and Doc Nix and The Green Machine filming their 2019 Band Camp. After the new student convocation (where they welcome the incoming freshman class) I started the process of editing the footage into the following recruitment video:
Band Camp 2019: WelcomeToday is the first rehearsal of the semester and we&amp;#039;re excited for some mid-week music making! Come check out our rehearsal in Dewberry Hall at 7:20pm, and don’t forget your instrument!</description>

      <description>The school I work for just migrated our Powerschool server offsite, introducing an issue for our internal applications which relied on the ODBC API to pull the class schedules for each day. Because the API does not employ encryption, simply opening the port on the remote server was not an option.
SSH provides the ability to tunnel network traffic through an encrypted SSH session. By binding this tunnel to the internal computer’s network interface, any other computer can simply connect to the proxy host.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Disposable Testing Environments With Docker</title>

      <description>Often times I find myself wanting to try out some piece of software from Github, a tutorial, or just have a fresh environment to work in that will avoid causing damage to my computer’s local environment. Typically I would use Vagrant to spin up a virtual machine, and delete it after. This is a time consuming and tedious process.
Docker provides a convienent method which gives you a clean environment that is destroyed when you finish with it.</description>

      <title>How to Create SharePoint Popups for New Item Forms</title>

      <description>By using modal popups instead of linking directly to the new item forms for a list, you can save the end user the frustration of having to go back and figure out where they were before they decided to click the link to add the item to the list, while also giving a much more polished look to the site in general.
Adding the button element While you can apply this method to direct links, it looks nicer if you create a button for the user to interact with, so put some place holder text where you want the button to go and then open the site in SharePoint Designer 2013.</description>

      <description>Today I had an amazing opportunity to take a tour and take photographs inside of NASA Langley Reasearch Center’s aircraft hanger. I thought I would share some of my photos and share some information on each one because some of it was really interesting.
What I’ll do is go through the pictures I have and explain some things about them right after each, so scroll down for some cool science equipment!</description>

      <description>Inspired by videos such as “Undertale – Megalovania {8 FDD, 2 SM}” by MrSolidSnake745 on YouTube, I decided in May of 2015 to try and make musical floppy drives of my own just so I can see what I could do with them. What quickly followed was me staying up until probably 1:30 in the morning figuring out how to make it work with the two drives that I had. I’ll write up what it took to get there once I’m finished making the final work, but here’s the video from that first prototype:</description>

      <title>DIY Laser Engraver for 80 USD</title>

      <description>This is the first real project that I started to work on. During winter break in 12th grade, I decided that I wanted to have a go at building a 3D Printer from scratch. Turned out that this was a fairly expensive thing to do on basically no budget so I decided instead to make a laser engraver by recycling any parts that I could find. The final cost ended up being around 70 dollars, something I was quite happy with.</description>
